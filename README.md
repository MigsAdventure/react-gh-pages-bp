This boiler-plate was made using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Basic boiler-plate to host with Github Pages using react with react-router.

`npm start` - Run dev server while watching for changes in sass files

`npm build` - Create a production build

`npm deploy` - Creates gh-pages branch if it doesn't exist and pushes production build folder to branch
